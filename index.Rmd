```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, 
                      message = FALSE, 
                      warning = FALSE,
                      comment = NA)

```

If you are not familiar with concepts of statistical inference such as random sampling, confidence intervals, or significance testing and p-values, I *highly* recommend [reading this](https://acobos.github.io/DA/statistical-inference.html) before the course starts.

- [Elements of statistical learning](https://hastie.su.domains/Papers/ESLII.pdf), by T. Hastie, R. Tibshirani and J. Friedman, is also a very good book on both classical and modern modeling methods, such as random forest, support vector machines or neural networks.
