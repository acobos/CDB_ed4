```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, 
                      message = FALSE, 
                      warning = FALSE,
                      comment = NA)

```

If you are not familiar with concepts of statistical inference such as random sampling, confidence intervals, or significance testing and p-values, I *highly* recommend [reading this](https://acobos.github.io/DA/statistical-inference.html) before the course starts.

## Readings 

### General

- A couple of free online books this course is loosely based on:
  - [Data Analysis for Clinical Researchers (Chap. 7 and 8)](https://acobos.github.io/DA/index.html). 
  - [Statistical Modeling for Clinical Researchers](https://acobos.github.io/SM/index.html).

- [A Studentâ€™s guide to R](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Horton+Pruim+Kaplan_MOSAIC-StudentGuide.pdf): free book on introductory and intermediate statistics with R.  


### Specific

- Do not use histograms to assess normality: [find out why](https://statisticsbyjim.com/basics/assessing-normality-histograms-probability-plots/).

- [Packages for ROC curves](https://rviews.rstudio.com/2019/03/01/some-r-packages-for-roc-curves/)

- [Survival analysis/plots cheat sheet](https://rpkgs.datanovia.com/survminer/survminer_cheatsheet.pdf)


- [The Elements of statistical learning](https://hastie.su.domains/ElemStatLearn/), by T. Hastie, R. Tibshirani and J. Friedman. A very good book on both classical and modern modeling methods, such as random forest, support vector machines or neural networks. Freely available as pdf.
